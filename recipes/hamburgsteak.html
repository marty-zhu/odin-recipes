      <li>Ketchup - 6 tbsp *</li>
      <li>Worcestershire sauce - 2 tbsp *</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make it?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Dice up the white onion and stir fry until golden.</li>
      <li>Mix all ingredients without the "*" mark in a mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Take the amount roughly the size of your palm and shape the meat into a ball.</li>
      <li>Toss the meat ball from one hand to the other 20 to 30 times until you feel its solid.</li>
      <li>Repeat until you've used all the mixed meat.</li>
      <li>Put a frying pan on medium heat.</li>
      <li>Place several meat patties in the frying pan and flip until both sides are brown.</li>
      <li>Add water up until 1/4 the height of the meat patties. Cover with lid and let cook.</li>
      <li>Occasionally shake the pan so that the meat won't stick.</li>
      <li>When the meat changes color, use a chopstick to poke a hole about half way through the meat. If the fluid flowing out of the opening is not clear, continue to cover and cook.</li>
      <li>Once you see clear oil flowing out of the opening. Take the hamburg patties out and place on serving plate.</li>
      <li>Immediately use the remaining oil in the pan to make the dressing by mixing all ingredients marked with "*" into the leftover oil.</li>
      <li>Cook on low heat until the ingredients become a paste.</li>
      <li>Pour the paste onto each hamburg and serve.</li>
      <li>Enjoy with friends and family!</li>
