    <h2 class="secondary">How to make it?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="tertiary">Dice up the white onion and stir fry until golden.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Mix all ingredients without the "*" mark in a mixing bowl.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Take the amount roughly the size of your palm and shape the meat into a ball.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Toss the meat ball from one hand to the other 20 to 30 times until you feel its solid.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Repeat until you've used all the mixed meat.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Put a frying pan on medium heat.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Place several meat patties in the frying pan and flip until both sides are brown.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Add water up until 1/4 the height of the meat patties. Cover with lid and let cook.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Occasionally shake the pan so that the meat won't stick.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">When the meat changes color, use a chopstick to poke a hole about half way through the meat. If the fluid flowing out of the opening is not clear, continue to cover and cook.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Once you see clear oil flowing out of the opening. Take the hamburg patties out and place on serving plate.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Immediately use the remaining oil in the pan to make the dressing by mixing all ingredients marked with "*" into the leftover oil.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Cook on low heat until the ingredients become a paste.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Pour the paste onto each hamburg and serve.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Enjoy with friends and family!</li>
