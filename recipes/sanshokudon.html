    <ol>

      <li>Put enough water in a pot to submerge all the snow peas, but just boil the water. The snow peas will go in after it is boiled.</li>
      <li>Remove the stem and the spine of each snow pea.</li>
      <li>When the water come to a boil, turn off the fire and put the processed snow peas in. Let cook without fire for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Pour out the water and cut the now cooked snow peas into 1/4 inch chunks. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Beat 4 eggs, pour into a pot, then mix with the ingredients marked with "*".</li>
      <li>Cook on low heat and use a pair of chopsticks to stir in a circular motion from the outside in.</li>
      <li>Once the eggs form into small chunks, turn off the fire and set them aside.</li>
      <li>Put ground meat and ingredients marked with "**" into a pot. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Once mixed, use low heat and stir until the meat changes color.</li>
      <li>Once the color has change, stir occasionally until the oil is almost gone.</li>
      <li>(OPTIONAL) If you would like it healthier, push the meat to one side of the pot and tilt toward the opposite side to separate the fat from the meat. Remove the fat with a spoon.</li>
      <li>Put enough rice into a bowl as you please. Use a large spoon to scoop the meat on to the rice. Add the cooked eggs and snow peas liberally.</li>
      <li>Your Tricolor Rice Bowl, or "sanshoku don", is complete.</li>
