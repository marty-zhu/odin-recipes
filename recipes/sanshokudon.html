      <li class="tertiary">Remove the stem and the spine of each snow pea.</li>

      <li class="tertiary">Pour out the water and cut the now cooked snow peas into 1/4 inch chunks. Set aside.</li>
      <li class="tertiary">Beat 4 eggs, pour into a pot, then mix with the ingredients marked with "*".</li>

      <li class="tertiary">Put ground meat and ingredients marked with "**" into a pot. Mix well.</li>
